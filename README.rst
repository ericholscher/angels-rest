Angel's reST
============

The one true way to generate reStructuredText into HTML. The goal is to standardize the commands and output that are used by services that render reST into HTML.

The current situation leaves you having to wonder why your ``.. code-block::`` directive worked on Crate and Pypi, but not Github or Bitbucket. We want to fix that by having all of these services support the same subset of reST.
